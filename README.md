**- Project 1:**

    - Image noise
    - Image filtering and transformations.

**- Project 2:**

    - Template matching under noise
    - Object detection using color histograms over overlapping patches with custom thresholds
    - Color segmentation and evaluation
**- Project 3:**

        - Feature extraction using SIFT,ORB,BRISK,and FAST algorithms
        - Dictionary learning using clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN, OPTICS)
        - Bag of Visual Words vectors creation of images
        - Training classifiers (SVM, KNeighbhours classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes) using BoVW.

**- Project 4:**

    - Training and comparison of CNN neural networks on three major CV tasks:
        - classification,
        - semantic segmentation,
        - image object detection.
    - The three models used were:
        - CNN model for classification of monkey species images,
        - UNet for semantic segmentation of lungs' xray images,
        - Pre-trained YOLOv3 for obejct detection on the MSCOCO dataset.
**- Project 5:**

    - Single object tracking in video using:
        - pre-trained HOG Description, 
        - Linear SVM, 
        - and pre-trained SSD neural network.
        and for tracking:
        - MeanShift tracker,
        - CamShift tracker
    - Multiple objects video tracking using:
        - BOOSTING algorithm,
        - CSRT algorithm,
        - KCF algorithm
    - Background substraction from video.
